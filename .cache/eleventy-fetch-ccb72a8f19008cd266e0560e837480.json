DCIP added that he was evacuated in a private vehicle to the Rafidia Surgical Hospital in Nablus, and was pronounced dead at around 3:45 am. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Israeli forces routinely resort to intentional lethal force in situations not justified under international law and make no effort to impartially investigate or ensure that Israeli soldiers act in accordance with international standards,” said Ayed Abu Eqtaish, accountability program director at DCIP. “Israeli forces’ near-daily incursions into Palestinian communities too often result in an Israeli soldier’s bullet in a Palestinian child’s body.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"660\" src=\"https://mondoweiss.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/070223_NABLUS_WN_2_00-4-1024x660.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-267974\" srcset=\"https://mondoweiss.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/070223_NABLUS_WN_2_00-4-1024x660.jpg 1024w, https://mondoweiss.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/070223_NABLUS_WN_2_00-4-300x193.jpg 300w, https://mondoweiss.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/070223_NABLUS_WN_2_00-4-150x97.jpg 150w, https://mondoweiss.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/070223_NABLUS_WN_2_00-4-768x495.jpg 768w, https://mondoweiss.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/070223_NABLUS_WN_2_00-4-1536x990.jpg 1536w, https://mondoweiss.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/070223_NABLUS_WN_2_00-4-1320x851.jpg 1320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Mourners carry the body of Hamza al-Ashqar, 17, who was shot dead by Israeli forces in the West Bank city of Nablus on February 7, 2023.
