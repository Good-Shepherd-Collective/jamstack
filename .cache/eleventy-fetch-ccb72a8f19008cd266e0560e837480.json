According to local sources, the special forces were targeting the apartment of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2002/11/27/israel-kills-2-senior-palestinian-militants/418baf41-2732-471d-93df-b0718b38841d/\">Alaa Sabbagh,</a> a former leader of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, Fatah’s armed wing, who was killed by Israeli forces in the camp in 2002.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sabbagh’s home was reportedly being used by a number of fighters affiliated with the <a href=\"https://mondoweiss.net/2022/11/inside-the-wasps-nest-the-rise-of-the-jenin-brigade/\">Jenin Brigade</a>, an armed resistance group from the camp composed of fighters from various political factions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Israeli forces fired rocket launchers and other explosives at the apartment building, causing the fighters inside to respond with live ammunition. The attack on the apartment also sparked clashes in the surrounding areas, with armed fighters firing toward the Israeli troops.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly after the operation began, “hundreds” of Israeli troops raided the area, with a convoy of military jeeps and bulldozers entering the boundaries of the camp. Sources told <em>Mondoweiss</em> that as the bulldozers moved through the streets, they destroyed cars parked in the area and “everything in their wake.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The troops entered the camp from the north, south, and western entrances of the camp, Mohammad Abed, a local journalist, told <em>Mondoweiss</em>. He added that Israeli forces closed off all the entrances and exits of the camp, preventing anyone from moving in or out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow alignwide\" data-effect=\"slide\"><div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_container swiper-container\"><ul class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_swiper-wrapper swiper-wrapper\"><li class=\"wp-block-jetpack-slideshow_slide swiper-slide\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"650\" alt=\"The Israeli army invades the West Bank city of Jenin on January 26, 2023.

Mourners chanted for the martyrs and vowed to persist for freedom as armed resistance fighters shot live ammunition in the air as a symbol of continued confrontation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The particularly high number of killings in the northern West Bank city can be attributed to the resurgence of armed resistance witnessed in the area, which the Israeli military <a href=\"https://mondoweiss.net/2022/12/a-year-of-resistance-and-repression-a-timeline-of-operation-break-the-wave/\">focused its efforts on quashing last year. </a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However with the persistence of Israeli settler expansion in tandem with a large-scale military assault dubbed <a href=\"https://mondoweiss.net/2022/12/a-year-of-resistance-and-repression-a-timeline-of-operation-break-the-wave/\">Operation Break the Wave</a>, Palestinian confrontation continues to grow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the beginning of the year, 178 acts of resistance were conducted from armed resistance groups in Jenin alone (also known as “<a href=\"https://mondoweiss.net/2022/11/inside-the-wasps-nest-the-rise-of-the-jenin-brigade/\">the Wasp’s Nest</a>&#8220;), according to the Palestinian Center for Information. This includes 42 shooting operations, while the rest range from stone throwing to impeding settler invasions into Palestinian towns and villages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following Thursday’s lethal assault in Jenin refugee camp, protests and clashes erupted in cities across the West Bank including Bethlehem, Ramallah, Qalqilya, Hebron, and Nablus. Additional protests by Palestinians with Israeli citizenship in Akka, Nazareth, and Umm El-Fahem were also planned for later Thursday evening. Youth in Gaza also set tires aflame near the border fence with Israel in protest against the killings in Jenin, according to local news reports.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"690\" src=\"https://mondoweiss.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/260123_HEBRON_MW_00-19-1024x690.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-267364\" srcset=\"https://mondoweiss.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/260123_HEBRON_MW_00-19-1024x690.jpg 1024w, https://mondoweiss.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/260123_HEBRON_MW_00-19-300x202.jpg 300w, https://mondoweiss.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/260123_HEBRON_MW_00-19-150x101.jpg 150w, https://mondoweiss.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/260123_HEBRON_MW_00-19-768x517.jpg 768w, https://mondoweiss.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/260123_HEBRON_MW_00-19-1536x1035.jpg 1536w, https://mondoweiss.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/260123_HEBRON_MW_00-19-1320x889.jpg 1320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Palestinian protesters in Hebron clash with Israeli soldiers after Israeli forces raided Jenin refugee camp and killed 9 Palestinians, January 26, 2023.

The ministry also recorded four injuries in Ramallah, and two others in Qalqilya and Bethlehem. Dozens of injuries as a result of teargas inhalation and high velocity canisters were treated on the field, according to the ministry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first month of 2023 has witnessed a steep increase in the average number of Palestinians killed compared to previous years. With 30 Palestinians killed in the first month of 2023 according to the MOH, the new year shows an intensified escalation in the Israeli assault on Palestinians.
